Perl Maven Development Environment

An environment to develop Perl-based applications.



========

to build a new release update

  bootstrap.sh
  modules.txt

Destroy exisiting box  (vagrant destroy)
and create a new one (vagrant up).

We might need to run (vagrant provision) several times
if some of the modules don't get installed on the first run.

We might need to manually copy the  bash_profile file
unless we can figure out why bootstrap.sh does not copy it.


======

To release a new box run

    vagrant package --output pde.box

Then upload to https://atlas.hashicorp.com/
