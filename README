Perl Maven Development Environment

An environment to develop Perl-based applications.



========

to build a new release form scratch update

  bootstrap.sh
  modules.txt

Destroy exisiting box  (vagrant destroy)
and create a new one (vagrant up).

(If we don't upgrade perl then I think we can start from the existing box)

We might need to run (vagrant provision) several times
if some of the modules don't get installed on the first run.

We might need to manually copy the  bash_profile file
unless we can figure out why bootstrap.sh does not copy it.


TODO: Add a script that will test some of the modules.



======

To release a new box run


    vagrant halt

    vagrant package --output pde.box

Then upload to https://atlas.hashicorp.com/

Select the 'Vagrant' menu item at the top: https://atlas.hashicorp.com/vagrant
Select the box:  szabgab/pde
New version
